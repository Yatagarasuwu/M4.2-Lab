# web-dev-starter

This is a starter project for web development with no frameworks and minimal
dependencies. It is intended to be a starting point for web development projects
that are written in plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
```
This will install the necessary dependencies for the project.

## Development

It is recommended to use the VSCode Live Server extension to run the project
locally. This will allow you to see changes in real-time as you make them. There
is no need to run a build process or refresh the page manually. Additionally,
you do not need to setup a local server to run the project.

## Testing

No testing was utilized for this project. Just visually identifying issues in the live server preview!


## Usage
Assuming you have the valid extension above, on windows use ctrl-shift-P and find "Live preview: Start Server" to see the webpage. You can also click the searchbar at the top and add ">" before typing the same thing.
